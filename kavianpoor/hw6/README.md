1-Randomly initialize the centroids.

2_Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.

3_update the centroids based on the mean of the assigned data points.

Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence or reaching the maximum number of iterations.

The complexity of this implementation can be analyzed as follows:

Randomly initializing the centroids has a complexity of O(k * d), where k is the number of clusters and d is the dimensionality of the data.
The main loop of the algorithm runs for a maximum of max_iterations, which is typically a small constant.
Assigning each data point to the nearest centroid requires calculating the Euclidean distance between each data point and each centroid, resulting in a complexity of O(n * k * d), where n is the number of data points.
Updating the centroids involves calculating the mean of the assigned data points for each cluster, resulting in a complexity of O(n * d).
The convergence check compares the old and new centroids, resulting in a complexity of O(k * d).
Overall, the complexity of the k-means algorithm without considering the maximum number of iterations is O(max_iterations * n * k * d). However, in practice, the algorithm often converges in a small number of iterations, making it more efficient.
