# Time complexity: 

The **time complexity** of the **km_means** function is primarliy determined by the iterations until convergence. 
The time complexity of each majot part of the function is analyzed:

1) Initialization of centroids:
  * If initial centroids are provided explicitly, it takes constant time, O(1).
  * If initial centroids are randomly chosen, it takes O(k), where k is the number of clusters.
  
  
2) Iterations until convergence:
  * Convergence check: Checking for convergence by comparing the new centroids with the old centroids has a time complexity of O(k * d), as we compare each centroid's coordinates.
  * Calculating the distances between all points and centroids takes O(n * k), where n is the number of data points and k is the number of clusters.
  * Assigning points to the centroid with the smallest distance also takes O(n * k).
  * Calculating the mean of each assignment group takes O(n * k * d), where d is the dimensionality of the data points.
  * Updating the centroids takes O(k * d), where k is the number of clusters and d is the dimensionality of the data points.
    
    
    
3) The overall time complexity of the km_means function can be approximated as O(i * n * k * d), where i is the number of iterations until convergence, n is the number of data points, k is the number of clusters, and d is the dimensionality of the data points.
